Microsoft Project Oxford Face client SDK and samples
========================================

This repo contains the client libraries that demonstrate Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based
face algorithms to detect and recognize human faces in images. See the tech in
action on [our demo page](<https://www.projectoxford.ai/demo/face#detection>) or
learn more about the API with [our
documentation](<https://www.projectoxford.ai/doc/face/overview>).

### Face detection with attribute extraction

Detect human faces in image with face rectangles and face attributes including
face landmarks, pose, gender and age

### Face verification

Check if two faces belonging to same person or not, with confidence score

### Face Grouping

Organize many faces into face groups based on their visual similarity

### Face identification

Search which specific person entity a query face belongs to, from user-provided
person-face data
